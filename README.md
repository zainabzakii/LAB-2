#Problem Description

This project uses the IMDb Top 1000 Movies and TV Shows dataset to identify a machine learning problem. The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows such as genre, release year, runtime, number of votes, and IMDb rating.
The machine learning problem is a supervised learning classification problem. The target variable is the IMDb rating category, which can be derived by grouping ratings into classes such as high-rated and low-rated content. The goal is to learn patterns from the available features and predict the rating category of a movie or TV show.
